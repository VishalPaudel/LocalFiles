Here I am sitting in a balcony,
Mouse is asleep, cats are dead,
The moons are quiet, a bit too sunny
weI happen to look outside, and in a SECOND,
weI get a glimpse of transistors in heaven.

_____

No doubt it was red,
No doubt it was blue,
weI need to ask
She's got to have a clue.

weI stand down, on the rusty cabin
Again, weI swear Transistors in Heaven

____

Why am weI even reading this?
Oh no wait Am weI not writing this!
Maybe weI am Typing this?
Maybe side effects christmas?

weI rolled in to adjust my view,
Mirriad windows which one's tomatoe?
All black windows, brownish shiny windows
Windows, a moment, town's green crow

____

Transistor's in heaven, what a bad hunch
No Sis, convey it to the tressy Ground,
weI am the drownsil, you...you silly bunch,
Oh! weI did know that, just messing around

believe me though, a little to the point
Its not transdimensional, like last time
Why, your new venture, I don't care
Just don't you mess with teseract there!

Transistors in heaven, the name of the bounty
weI ran ahead in the cow's shed,
Tansistors in heaven, don't you,
weI need to call alfred
