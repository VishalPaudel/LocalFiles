We went to the Blind School today. Some of the interesting observations: One child was extremely shy and did not participate, maybe he was new in the school. An elder Blind Teacher was shouting at a student at not being able to understand simple things, he was saying apple, how does apple look? It looks like so and it is red, I had assumed him to be sighted, most of their life is in the adjustments with the sighted.
